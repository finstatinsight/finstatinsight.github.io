|      Quarters       | 2023-Q1 | 2023-Q2 | 2023-Q3 |
|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Items             | 3/31/2023 | 6/30/2023 | 9/30/2023 |
| Aesthetic services  | 14,930  | 15,923  | 13,074  |
| General medical services | 1,379 | 1,432 | 1,804   |
| Sale of skincare products | 502 | 537   | 635     |
| **Total**               | **16,811**  | **17,892**  | **15,513** |

**Loss Before Tax:** Despite the revenue generated, the Group recorded a loss before tax amounting to RM3.13 million. This loss was primarily attributed to administrative expenses totaling around RM9.15 million.

**Administrative Expenses Breakdown:** The substantial administrative expenses included one-off non-recurring listing expenses and consultancy fees related to the IPO exercise, amounting to RM3.85 million for the quarter under review. Substracting 3.85 millions, there is 5.3 millions of "others" administrative expenses. 

**Adjusted Profit Before Tax:** Adjusting for the one-off listing expenses and consultancy fees associated with the IPO exercise, the company achieved an adjusted profit before tax of RM0.72 million for the financial quarter under review.

This financial snapshot indicates a challenging quarter for DC Healthcare Holdings Berhad, marked by a significant loss before tax primarily due to ***exceptional expenses*** related to the IPO exercise. However, the adjusted profit before tax reflects a more positive underlying operational performance once these one-off costs are excluded. It suggests that, beyond the exceptional expenses, the core business activities are contributing positively to the company's financial position.

### Growth Plan / Aquisitions of I Bella Sdn Bhd

DC Healthcare's proposed acquisition of 200,000 ordinary shares in **I Bella Sdn Bhd** ("IBella") from Then Yen Tsing ("TYT") and Arrow Peak Sdn Bhd ("Arrow Peak") signifies a strategic move to obtain 100% equity interest in IBella. The total purchase consideration for this acquisition is set at a substantial amount of up to RM70,000,000.

The proposed transaction will be structured with a combination of cash and the issuance of new ordinary shares in DC Healthcare. Specifically, up to RM35,000,000 will be paid in cash as the Cash Consideration, while the remaining RM35,000,000 will be satisfied by issuing 60,344,828 new ordinary shares in DC Healthcare at an Issue Price of RM0.58 per Share. These newly issued shares, referred to as "Consideration Shares," are a significant component of the overall purchase consideration.

This acquisition strategy allows DC Healthcare to leverage its existing financial resources through a combination of liquid assets (cash) and equity issuance. The issuance of new shares serves as a means of financing the acquisition, providing an alternative to using exclusively cash reserves.

The Issue Price of RM0.58 per Share is a critical aspect of the transaction, representing the valuation at which DC Healthcare is willing to dilute its ownership in exchange for acquiring IBella. The pricing reflects the perceived value of IBella and the strategic importance of the acquisition to DC Healthcare's overall business objectives.

Upon completion of the Proposed Acquisition, DC Healthcare will gain complete ownership of IBella, potentially unlocking synergies and strategic advantages for both entities. The acquisition aligns with DC Healthcare's growth strategy, allowing the company to diversify its portfolio or strengthen its position in the market.
