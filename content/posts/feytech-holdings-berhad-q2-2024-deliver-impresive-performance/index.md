**Feytech Holdings Berhad**, a leading manufacturer of automotive seats and covers in Malaysia, has announced strong financial results for the second quarter ended 30 June 2024. The company's revenue and profitability continue to be driven by the expansion of its manufacturing operations and the robust demand for its products.
Here are some key highlights of Feytech's Q2 performance.

As of Q2 2024, RM21 million of the IPO proceeds had been utilized, primarily for working capital. The remaining funds are allocated for land acquisition, construction of new facilities, purchase of machinery, and listing expenses.

## Profit and Loss Analysis
- **Revenue** reached RM68.20 million for the quarter, a marginal decrease of 3% from the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributed to a decline in customer demand for automotive covers. The company's automotive seat segment generated RM36.95 million in sales, accounting for 54.18% of total revenue, while the automotive cover segment contributed RM31.25 million or 45.82%. It's evident that the automotive covers segment experienced a more significant decline, while the automotive seats segment remained relatively stable.
- **Profit before tax (PBT)** stood at RM22.23 million, with a PBT margin of 32.60%. Notably, this figure includes one-off listing expenses of approximately RM1.05 million incurred during the quarter. After adjusting for these expenses, the adjusted PBT reached RM23.28 million, reflecting a robust adjusted PBT margin of 34.14%.
- **Profit after tax (PAT)** amounted to RM16.52 million, representing a PAT margin of 24.23%.

## Balance Sheet Highlights
### Assets
- **Property, plant, and equipment:** Decreased slightly from RM41.005 million in Q1 to RM40.254 million in Q2 . This reduction could be due to depreciation, asset sales, or both.
**Inventories:** Rose from RM40.760 million in Q1 to RM44.978 million in Q2. This buildup might signal the company stocking up in anticipation of future demand. It could also suggest challenges in inventory management, something to keep an eye on.

The company's commitment to expanding its manufacturing capacity, coupled with the ongoing demand for its automotive seats and covers, positions it well for continued growth and profitability.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that external factors, such as the overall economic climate in Malaysia, government policies and regulations, and competition within the automotive industry, can potentially influence Feytech's performance.

### Feytech's Management Challenges:
Addressing Declining Demand for Automotive Covers: Feytech's management needs to counteract the declining demand for automotive covers. Potential strategies include:
- Product diversification: Expanding into new product lines within the automotive accessories market or related industries could reduce reliance on a single product segment.
- Market research: In-depth market research to understand shifting consumer preferences and identify new market opportunities could guide product development and marketing efforts.
- Competitive pricing strategies: Adjusting pricing to remain competitive in the market while maintaining profitability.

### Managing Working Capital Effectively: 
The increase in inventories and trade receivables calls for effective working capital management to ensure sufficient cash flow. Feytech should focus on:
- Optimizing inventory levels: Implement inventory management systems to ensure optimal inventory levels and - minimize storage costs while meeting demand.
- Improving collection processes: Streamline invoicing and collections to reduce outstanding receivables and minimize the risk of bad debts.
- Negotiating favorable payment terms with suppliers: Extend payment terms with suppliers to improve cash flow, while maintaining good relationships.


### Conclusion
Feytech's Q2 2024 financial performance showcases a company in a dynamic growth phase. While revenue declined slightly due to challenges in the automotive covers segment, the company remains profitable, with an adjusted PBT exceeding that of Q1. The IPO significantly bolstered Feytech's cash position, providing resources to fuel its ambitious expansion plans.

Feytech's future appears promising. However, management faces key challenges, including addressing declining demand for automotive covers, effectively executing large-scale expansion projects, maintaining profitability amidst these investments, and managing working capital efficiently. The company's success will depend on its ability to navigate these challenges strategically and adapt to evolving market conditions.
