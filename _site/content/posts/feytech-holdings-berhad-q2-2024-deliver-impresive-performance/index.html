<p><strong>Feytech Holdings Berhad</strong>, a leading manufacturer of automotive seats and covers in Malaysia, has announced strong financial results for the second quarter ended 30 June 2024. The company’s revenue and profitability continue to be driven by the expansion of its manufacturing operations and the robust demand for its products.
Here are some key highlights of Feytech’s Q2 performance.</p>

<p>As of Q2 2024, RM21 million of the IPO proceeds had been utilized, primarily for working capital. The remaining funds are allocated for land acquisition, construction of new facilities, purchase of machinery, and listing expenses.</p>

<h2 id="profit-and-loss-analysis">Profit and Loss Analysis</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Revenue</strong> reached RM68.20 million for the quarter, a marginal decrease of 3% from the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily attributed to a decline in customer demand for automotive covers. The company’s automotive seat segment generated RM36.95 million in sales, accounting for 54.18% of total revenue, while the automotive cover segment contributed RM31.25 million or 45.82%. It’s evident that the automotive covers segment experienced a more significant decline, while the automotive seats segment remained relatively stable.</li>
  <li><strong>Profit before tax (PBT)</strong> stood at RM22.23 million, with a PBT margin of 32.60%. Notably, this figure includes one-off listing expenses of approximately RM1.05 million incurred during the quarter. After adjusting for these expenses, the adjusted PBT reached RM23.28 million, reflecting a robust adjusted PBT margin of 34.14%.</li>
  <li><strong>Profit after tax (PAT)</strong> amounted to RM16.52 million, representing a PAT margin of 24.23%.</li>
