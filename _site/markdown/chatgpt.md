{{Autocount Dotcom Berhad: FY2025 Performance Review for the First Three Quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0 Introduction

This document provides a formal performance review of Autocount Dotcom Berhad and its subsidiaries ("the Group") for the nine-month financial period ending 30 September 2025. The analysis is based on the unaudited interim financial reports for the first, second, and third quarters of the fiscal year 2025 (Q1, Q2, and Q3 FY2025). This review will analyze the Group's cumulative and quarter-over-quarter performance, examine its key revenue drivers, assess its overall financial health, and conclude with an overview of its strategic outlook and corporate initiatives.

2.0 Cumulative Financial Performance (Nine Months Ended 30 September 2025)

Analyzing year-to-date (YTD) performance is of strategic importance as it offers a comprehensive measure of the Group's growth trajectory over a meaningful period. This cumulative view smooths out the volatility that can occur within a single quarter, providing stakeholders with a clearer and more stable picture of the Group's progress toward its annual objectives.

The Group delivered a robust performance in the first nine months of FY2025, demonstrating significant growth compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.

Key Performance Indicator	9 Months Ended 30 Sep 2025 (RM’000)	9 Months Ended 30 Sep 2024 (RM’000)	Year-over-Year Change (%)
Revenue	61,382	45,531	+34.81%
Gross Profit	52,228	31,703	+64.74%
Profit Before Tax (PBT)	37,477	18,971	+97.55%
Profit After Tax (PAT)	27,412	14,357	+90.93%
Basic EPS (sen)	4.98	2.61	+90.80%

The Group's revenue for the nine-month period grew by 34.81% to RM61,382 thousand, while Profit Before Tax (PBT) surged by an impressive 97.55% to RM37,477 thousand. The disproportionate increase in profitability highlights the Group's significant operating leverage. With a relatively fixed cost structure where a large portion of expenses do not correlate directly with revenue, the higher top-line performance translated into amplified bottom-line growth, a critical insight for assessing the Group's earnings potential.

These strong year-to-date results were driven by varied performance across the three quarters, which warrants a more detailed sequential analysis.

3.0 Quarter-by-Quarter Performance Analysis

A sequential quarterly analysis is crucial for understanding the operational momentum and specific market dynamics that influenced the Group's performance throughout the year. This section deconstructs the financial results of each quarter to identify key trends and the causal factors behind them.

3.1 Q1 FY2025 (Ended 31 March 2025)

The first quarter marked an exceptionally strong start to the fiscal year, with significant growth both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.

Performance Indicator	Q1 FY2025 (RM’000)	Year-over-Year Comparison<br>Q1 FY2024 (RM’000)	Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison<br>Q4 FY2024 (RM’000)
Revenue	25,554	13,668	15,068
PBT	18,029	5,375	6,449

Compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year, Q1 FY2025 revenue increased by 86.96%, while PBT grew by a remarkable 235.42%. Sequentially, revenue and PBT rose by 69.59% and 179.56% respectively against the immediate preceding quarter (Q4 FY2024). This exceptional performance was primarily attributed to a significant increase in demand for the e-invoicing module within the Group's core segment of financial management software distribution.

3.2 Q2 FY2025 (Ended 30 June 2025)

The second quarter presented mixed results, with continued strong year-over-year growth but a notable decline from the record-breaking first quarter.

Performance Indicator	Q2 FY2025 (RM’000)	Year-over-Year Comparison<br>Q2 FY2024 (RM’000)	Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison<br>Q1 FY2025 (RM’000)
Revenue	20,173	13,512	25,554
PBT	11,963	5,979	18,029

On a year-over-year basis, the Group maintained its growth trajectory, with revenue increasing by 49.30% and PBT doubling by 100.08%, driven by higher software distribution revenue.

However, when compared to the preceding quarter (Q1 FY2025), revenue and PBT decreased by 21.06% and 33.65%, respectively. This decline was primarily caused by lower demand for the e-invoicing module following the government's announcement of a deferment in the implementation of the e-invoicing system for smaller businesses. The quarter's profitability was also impacted by several cost factors: an underprovision of staff bonuses from the previous financial year resulting in higher staff-related expenses, and professional fees incurred for the Group's ongoing transfer listing exercise.

3.3 Q3 FY2025 (Ended 30 September 2025)

The third quarter saw a continuation of market normalization following the Q1 peak, with performance influenced by both external factors and a high prior-year comparable.

Performance Indicator	Q3 FY2025 (RM’000)	Year-over-Year Comparison<br>Q3 FY2024 (RM’000)	Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison<br>Q2 FY2025 (RM’000)
Revenue	15,655	18,351	20,173
PBT	7,485	7,617	11,963

Year-over-year, revenue declined by 14.66%. The decrease was due to a high revenue base in the prior year's corresponding quarter (Q3 FY2024), which had benefited significantly from the MSME Digitalisation Grant. Despite the lower revenue, the PBT margin improved from 41.51% in Q3 FY2024 to 47.81% in Q3 FY2025. This margin enhancement demonstrates that the Group's underlying profitability is strong, even on lower revenue, when not encumbered by lower-margin activities like the grant-related sales, which required associated outsourcing fees to be paid to dealers.

On a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenue and PBT continued to decline by 22.40% and 37.43%, respectively. This was again attributed to the sustained impact of the deferment of the e-invoicing system implementation. The quarterly fluctuations, driven largely by the e-invoicing demand and prior-year grant effects, underscore the importance of examining the concentration of the Group's core revenue streams.

4.0 Analysis of Revenue Drivers

Understanding the sources of revenue by business segment and geography is essential for assessing the stability and concentration of the Group's income streams. This analysis provides critical insight into core operational strengths and market dependencies.

4.1 Revenue by Business Segment

The Group's revenue is primarily generated from its core activity of distributing financial management software.

Business Segment	9 Months Revenue (RM’000)	Percentage of Total
Distribution of financial management software	57,072	92.98%
Technical support & maintenance	2,766	4.51%
Others	1,544	2.52%
Total	61,382	100.00%

For the first nine months of FY2025, the Distribution of financial management software segment was the overwhelming contributor, accounting for 92.98% of total revenue. This concentration, while demonstrating market leadership, exposes the Group to segment-specific risks and market headwinds, as evidenced by the Q2 and Q3 performance following the e-invoicing deferment.

4.2 Revenue by Geography

Geographically, the Group's operations are heavily concentrated in its home market.

Geography	9 Months Revenue (RM’000)	Percentage of Total
Malaysia	56,012	91.25%
Singapore	4,715	7.69%
Others	655	1.06%
Total	61,382	100.00%

The Malaysia market is the primary driver of the Group's revenue, contributing 91.25% of the total for the period, with Singapore remaining the major overseas market. The overwhelming reliance on the domestic market presents both a stable foundation and a key risk, highlighting the strategic importance of the regional expansion funded by IPO proceeds.

5.0 Financial Position and Cash Flow Summary

Evaluating the statement of financial position and cash flows is vital for a holistic view of the Group's performance. These statements provide critical insights into the Group's asset base, liquidity, and overall financial resilience beyond its reported profitability.

5.1 Statement of Financial Position

A comparison of the Group's balance sheet reveals a dynamic shift in its capital structure over the nine-month period.

Balance Sheet Item (RM'000)	As at 30 Sep 2025	As at 31 Dec 2024	Change
Total Assets	80,614	75,915	+6.19%
Total Equity	56,694	62,335	-9.05%
Total Liabilities	23,920	13,580	+76.14%
Net Assets per Share (RM)	0.10	0.11	-9.09%

Total assets grew moderately, while the 76.14% increase in total liabilities was primarily driven by rises in Current tax liabilities, Other payables, and Contract liabilities. The growth in contract liabilities, which represents deferred revenue, is a positive indicator of future recognized income. The decrease in total equity reflects a deliberate capital allocation choice to return significant capital to shareholders through dividends. This decision demonstrates management's confidence in its operational cash generation to fund both shareholder returns and ongoing growth initiatives.

5.2 Cash Flow Analysis

The Group's cash flow statement for the nine months ended 30 September 2025 reflects strong operational performance alongside significant returns to shareholders.

* Net cash from operating activities: RM 37,701,000
* Net cash used in investing activities: RM (5,157,000)
* Net cash used in financing activities: RM (33,086,000)

The Group generated a robust RM37.7 million in cash from its core operations, demonstrating healthy underlying profitability and efficient working capital management. Cash used in financing activities was dominated by dividend payments to shareholders, which totaled RM33,030,000. These payments were distributed evenly across the period, with RM11,010,000 paid in each of the three quarters. The strength of the Group's financial position and cash generation provides a solid foundation for its forward-looking prospects.

6.0 Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Outlook

This final section synthesizes the Group's forward-looking statements and strategic actions, providing context on how management plans to leverage its current position to drive future growth and shareholder value. The Group remains confident in its ability to capitalize on favorable market trends.

The Group's prospects are supported by several key growth drivers and strategic initiatives:

* Favorable Market Trends: There is increasing demand for streamlined financial management and automation, driven by the accelerating pace of digitalization, which is crucial for businesses to remain agile.
* Governmental Support: Digital transformation initiatives across Southeast Asia, including a RM50.00 million digitalization grant under Malaysia's Budget 2025, are expected to create a favorable environment. These grants specifically support the adoption of e-POS systems, CRM systems, digital marketing, e-commerce, and remote working solutions, aligning directly with the Group's product offerings.
* Strategic Positioning: The Group is confident in its ability to capitalize on industry growth, with expansion plans supported by proceeds from its Initial Public Offering (IPO).
* Product Innovation & Partnerships: Recent strategic moves have strengthened market presence, including the launch of AutoCount e-Invoicing solutions, the introduction of AutoCount OneSales PalmPOS for micro-SMEs, and a partnership with IAB LCCI to launch Asia’s first cloud accounting program.

On the corporate front, the Group is actively utilizing proceeds from its IPO for regional expansion and to strengthen its research and development capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed transfer of the Group's listing from the ACE Market to the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad is pending completion.

In conclusion, despite quarterly fluctuations influenced by external policy changes, Autocount Dotcom Berhad's strong cumulative results for the first nine months of FY2025, combined with its clear strategic initiatives and solid financial footing, position it well for anticipated future growth in the dynamic digital technology sector.
